### Dredging Statistics

Dredge maintenance is an essential operation to ensure navigable waterways. Tasks and planning associated with dredge maintenance is the responsibility of the United States Corps of Engineers (USCAE), who has regularly partnered with academic researchers to improve how dredge decisions are made. A vital component to annual dredge planning is the scheduling of a dredge fleet to job locations throughout the year. These decisions rely on information regarding waterway network connectivity, dredge fleet production rates and capacity, environmental limitations from protected animal species throughout the year, and federal budget limitations. Existing planning tools that assist USACE in these planning efforts rely on regular and reliable access to these data sets. This use case will demonstrate how the TransMAP Hub will be used to support existing dredge planning efforts and expand the capabilities for users to monitor and adjust these plans throughout the year.

## National Channel Framework

The National Channel Framework (NCF) is an enterprise Geographic Information System (eGIS) database providing information about congressionally authorized navigation channels maintained by the US Army Corps of Engineers. This service includes channel details based on district-managed GIS polygons rather than on CAD-based linework, and is maintained through the eHydro hydrographic survey application. Details include reaches, channel areas, quarters, centerlines, and stationing.

## Navigational Charts

This service shows all navigation channels maintained by USACE districts that have completed all or portions of the National Channel Framework through eHydro. Unlke the National Channel Framework, this is a raster service (map-based) and is intented not for quantitative analysis but for qualitative analysis and contextual background. It is rich with map features.
