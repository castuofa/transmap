!!! note ""
    Schematic showing the most important elements of TransMAP Hub and how they interoperate. The system is deliberately kept as simple as possible while addressing the need to access and integrate possibly large amounts of data. Note the absence of Accumulo/Cassandra/Hbase HDFS elements.
